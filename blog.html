        <h2>Ideas Triggered by Wes Moore</h2>
        <p class="blog">Wes Moore is a military veteran, author and business man. He grew up in an underprivileged area in Baltimore and later the Bronx in New York. He went to a military boarding school then later attended Johns Hopkins University and was a Rhodes Scholar. His most popular novel The other Wes Moore highlights his journey from a small fatherless boy to successful citizen of America.</p>

        <p class="blog">The first thing that he started with was that people need to think that you care before they care what you think. I believe this empathy is essential whether one is dealing with little kids or with older people because it creates a basis for honesty and genuine self-expression.</p>

        <p class="blog">The questions that he encouraged were:</p>

        <p class="blog">Who will you fight for and who matters to you?</p>

        <p class="blog">He said that one small academic setback or one small collegiate failure shouldn’t affect you because these things ephemeral. What you need to always have in the back of your mind is answering that question that means so much to you.</p>

        <p class="blog">When asked about leadership he said that being a mentor is the way you walk, talk and think about the world. I believe this boils down to the idea of leading by example. Allow people to see the way you interact with people and then forge their own path towards following you. This follows with the idea of not telling people what to think, but to just make them think. Hence, guiding them to something they themselves feel passionate about.</p>

        <p class="blog">Another beautiful phrase I heard was “patience is something you do when you feel entitled to a future.” Nothing in this world comes without hard work and while we can “let’s sprint, and work with an unbridled impatience.”</p>

        <p class="blog">The final question he posed was “How do I want to be remembered?” When it’s time for you to leave a school, job, home, or even this world make sure that it mattered you were even there.</p>

        <p class="blog">While all these undertakings seem daunting, don’t worry about what you can’t do, or what you will be able to do in the future, just worry about what you can do today. With this mentality see out opportunities by making the proper “connections and impressions” that will make someone believe in you. Know that every room that you’re in you were meant to be there and that you belong. With this mentality enjoy and learn from your experiences, and walk into every room with an unmatched confidence. For example, (Shout to my friend Greg) wearing a swag suit with a nice flower and bowtie, and then going on to jump off the stage after a speech.</p>

        <p class="blog">Finally, everything comes down to passion. Every person who was great was doing something they were passionate about, and it’s up to us to find something that’s worth getting up for every day.</p>

        <h2>Ideas triggered by Listening to Eva Vega</h2>
        <p class="blog">Eva was a Latina, catholic woman who was working for the Anti-Defamation League which serves to eliminate racism and prejudice towards all races and religions. She said one beautiful thing that I will not forget: Honor the human being for their existence. Every single person that crosses your path has their own story, and their own contributions. While we are the center of our own universe empathizing with another’s story allows us to see the world in a different view. A view that makes us kinder and more considerate individuals.</p>

        <h2>Ideas triggered by Listening to Nathaniel Cole</h2>
        <p class="blog">Leadership is a lifestyle, and it’s developing other people. To be a successful leader one has to live leadership regardless of the position. Hence, a position does not make you a leader; leadership brings you a position.</p>

        <p class="blog">The next paramount thing is to know your brand. What is it that makes you, you. What is it that makes you different from everyone else? What are the qualities, and characteristics that come with you when someone has the pleasure of meeting you? Whether its how you dress, act or speak, know what makes you who you are and no matter the circumstance don’t even leave those core values.  </p>

        <p class="blog">Failure can be rocking. Hence, always know that you are regular, and remain humble because when you fall from being the king of your world, it can be truly hurtful. Hence, you need the people around you to help with criticism and failure because in leadership these to setbacks are inevitable.  </p>

        <p class="blog">I had the privilege on meeting a man named Nathaniel Cole who is a director in a non-profit known as Urban Alliance. He asked me and the students in the crowd if we knew our most core value. In the most confident, reassuring, unwavering voice, he said that his most core value was his faith in God. Whether its god or any other quality know what that core value is and never let that waver or falter no matter the circumstance that surrounds you.  </p>
