    <p>Many times we attribute our success to our own efforts and grind, however what we fail to realize is that we are mere beneficiaries in a greater scheme of chance that allowed us to achieve what we have. </p>
    <p>Hence, I strive to take the opportunities that were given to to me, to create even more opportunities for the people and communities around myself.</p>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! Inside you will find my resume and interests. </p>
