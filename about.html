      <p>I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Miami. I was born in India and live in Orlando Fl. My hobbies include outdoor activities such as tennis, basketball, table tennis and biking. I also enjoy the fine arts through music, playing the tabla, reading and writing.
      <p>I have come to realize that many times we attribute our success to our own efforts and grind, however what we fail to realize is that we are mere beneficiaries in a greater scheme of chance that allowed us to achieve what we have. </p>
      <p>Hence, I strive to take the opportunities that were given to to me, to create even more opportunities for the people and communities around myself.</p>
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio! Inside you will find my resume, music endeavors and musings. </p>
